Overview of the project

Project:Simple calculator

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a simple calculator using Python programming that can perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator will provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to input two numbers and select the desired operation to obtain the result. 

Key activities:
Defining Functions: Create functions for each arithmetic operation.
User Interface: Implement a command-line interface for user interaction.
Error Handling: Add checks and handle errors like invalid inputs and division by zero.
Loop and Exit: Use a loop to allow continuous use of the calculator until the user decides to exit.
Testing: Ensure all functionalities work as expected through testing

Technologies used:
1)Python Standard Library:
Basic Arithmetic Operations: You can use Python's built-in arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to perform basic calculations.
2)Math Library
